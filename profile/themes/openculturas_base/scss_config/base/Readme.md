# Base Styles

A base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendent selector, 
or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It does not include any 
class or ID selectors. It defines the default styling for how that element should 
look in all occurrences on the page.

Example Base Styles:

```
body,
form {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

a {
    color: #039;
}

a:hover {
    color: #03F;
}
```

This is also basic for the WYSIWYG editor stylesheet.
