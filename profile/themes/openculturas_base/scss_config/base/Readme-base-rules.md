# Base Styles

A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.

Example Base Styles:

```
body,
form {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

a {
    color: #039;
}

a:hover {
    color: #03F;
}
```
